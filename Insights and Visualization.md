# Insights and Findings

## Cost Evaluation

1. **Cost Distribution by HMO Category:** The analysis reveals that 63% of the total cost of healthcare services between 2019 and 2020 is consumed by public HMO enrollees, while private HMO enrollees account for 37%. This disparity in cost distribution suggests that cost optimization strategies may need to be tailored differently for public and private HMOs.

2. **Top 3 Most Active HMOs:** The top three most active HMOs based on their total cost of healthcare services are:
   - Princeton (10% of total cost)
   - Songhai (11% of total cost)
   - WiseHealth (12% of total cost)

   These HMOs have been more active in utilizing healthcare services compared to the other 83 HMOs. Focusing on understanding their specific needs and service utilization patterns can lead to more targeted and effective cost management.

3. **Departmental Cost Analysis:** Among the four departments in Almadina Clinic, the Pharmacy takes the largest share of the total insurance cost (50%), followed by Inpatient (20%), Laboratory (17%), and Clinic (13%). Understanding these cost distributions can help optimize resource allocation and improve cost efficiencies in each department.

4. **Pharmacy Operations:** The analysis indicates that the Pharmacy operates independently, providing drugs to insurance enrollees from the Clinic. The drugs given to insurance enrollees by the Clinic are registered as credits for the Clinic to pay back. Over the past two years, the Pharmacy has credited the Clinic with ₦206,676,896. This insight suggests that improving the coordination and management of pharmacy expenses could contribute to better cost control.

5. **10% Co-Payment Compliance:** As stipulated in the NHIS Regulation and Guidelines, all public enrollees are expected to pay 10% for every drug purchase, while 90% will be covered by the National Health Insurance Scheme. The total 10% captured for this timeframe was ₦13,518,636. Monitoring and encouraging compliance with co-payment policies can lead to better cost recovery and financial sustainability.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights and findings from the Cost Efficiency Analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Segmented Cost Optimization Strategies:** Implement different cost optimization strategies for public and private HMOs, considering their varying cost distributions and utilization patterns.

2. **Targeted Engagement with Top HMOs:** Engage with the top three most active HMOs (Princeton, Songhai, and WiseHealth) to understand their needs and identify areas where cost management efforts can be focused to achieve the best impact.

3. **Departmental Resource Allocation:** Optimize resource allocation among the four departments (Pharmacy, Inpatient, Laboratory, and Clinic) based on their cost share and service utilization. Allocating resources efficiently can improve overall cost-effectiveness.

4. **Enhanced Pharmacy-Department Coordination:** Strengthen coordination between the Pharmacy and Clinic departments to ensure seamless credit management for drugs provided to insurance enrollees. Improving credit management can have a positive impact on cost control.

5. **Promote 10% Co-Payment Compliance:** Educate public enrollees about the importance of 10% co-payment compliance. Effective communication can lead to increased cost recovery and support the sustainability of the healthcare services.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Analysis:** Regularly monitor cost trends, HMO performance, and departmental metrics to identify emerging patterns and opportunities for improvement. Analyzing data continuously can facilitate data-driven decision-making and cost mitigation efforts.

## Conclusion

The Cost Efficiency Analysis of healthcare services in Almadina Clinic provides valuable insights into the cost distribution, HMO performance, and departmental cost allocation. By leveraging these insights and following the recommendations, Almadina Clinic can optimize costs, enhance cost recovery, and improve overall financial efficiency.
